Do not delete this project!  It demonstrates how to create a Django project
that uses django-pipeline to cache-bust and minify static files.  It also
demonstrates both how add Sass to the project and the basics of using Sass.

As it turns out, once you have django-pipeline working and you install the Live
Sass Compiler into VS Code, configure it properly, and set up your static
directory structure, putting your .scss files alongside the .css files, Django,
django-pipeline, and Sass appear to work pretty seamlessly together.  Once you
configure Sass properly, it seemed that I didn't even need to run the
collectstatic command; Sass would automatically put the new .css output files
where they needed to go.
